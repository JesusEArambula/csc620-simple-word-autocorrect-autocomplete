# csc620-simple-word-autorrect-autocomplete
Second assignment for CSC 620 Natural Language Technologies

This program uses the nltk module to import an English corpus and make tokenization easier.
There are a total of 4 steps in this assignment:
1. Import an English corpus and tokenize a string.
2. Count the total words (types) and unique words (types) in the string.
3. Count the relative frequency of each unique word in the string.
4. Take a user input and will check if the input is in the English corpus. If not, the program will search the corpus for similar words to that of the user input.

This program was meant to get the students prepared with using nltk and how we can have machines try to guess what a user is trying to communicate.
This is a important aspect in natural language programming.
